# 🚀 Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

I have been coding and Practicing one of the **most complete, efficient, and cleanly coded Python repositories** for advanced data structures and algorithmic problems for more than 6+ years.  This are a curated collection of real-world relevant, interview-ready, and system-level algorithm implementations — each designed with **clean code**, **efficiency**, and **clarity** in mind.


## 📂 Project Structure
├── sorting
├── searching
├── graphs
├── trees
├── arrays_strings
├── dynamic_programming
├── linked_lists
Each folder contains:
- ✅ Standalone `.py` file(s) for each algorithm
- ✅ Clear function/class implementation
- ✅ Sample test/demo in `if __name__ == "__main__":`
- ✅ Pythonic, readable, and reusable code

---

## 🧱 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔁 Sorting
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

### 🔍 Searching
- Binary Search
- Shifted Binary Search

### 🌐 Graphs
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- (Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Cycle Detection — coming next!)

### 🌳 Trees
- Binary Search Tree Construction
- Inorder Traversal
- (Diameter & Validation — coming next)

### 📦 Arrays & Strings
- Array of Products (no division)
- Balanced Brackets (valid parentheses)
- Caesar Cipher Encryptor
- First Duplicate Value

### 🔢 Dynamic Programming
- Nth Fibonacci (iterative, O(n))
- Max Subset Sum No Adjacent
- Maximum Product Subarray

### 🔗 Linked Lists
- Reverse Linked List
- Remove Duplicates from Linked List
- (Sum of Linked Lists — coming next)

## ✨ Why This Repo Stands Out

- **Readable:** Clear function names, typing, and structured formatting
- **Efficient:** Optimized logic with O(1), O(n), or O(log n) where possible
- **Practical:** Based on real interview and system design problems
- **Testable:** Every file has an example driver/test case
- **Ready to Extend:** Modular design to plug into projects or backend systems
